<h2>About</h2>
    <p>New to the world of technology, I decided to enroll at the <em>College of Western Idaho</em> for their <i>Associate Degree in Software Development</i> program. <br> <br>
    
    I am in the beginning stages of my programming degree, so I have my primary experience in a more backend language, C#. My plan for future schooling is to enroll in more clubs and areas of participation, like their <i>Cyber Security Club</i>. Currently I am beginning to learn more frontend languages, such as HTML and CSS. <br> <br>
    
    Previously to my school enrollment, I was a successful hairdresser and salon owner. I happily stood behind the chair for 12 years, until I got the courage to try something new. The change is a large one, but I know my experience working with different people to achieve desired outcomes was built in my previous industry.</p>
